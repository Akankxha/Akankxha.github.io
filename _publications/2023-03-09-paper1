excerpt: 'Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer worldwide. Understanding metabolic adaptation and its heterogeneity in tumor tissues may provide new insights and help in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. This study investigates metabolic alterations in EC through integrative analysis of transcriptomics data and genome-scale metabolic networks, identifying distinct metabolic subtypes with clinical significance.'
