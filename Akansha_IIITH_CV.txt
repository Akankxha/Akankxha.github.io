PhD Researcher
 Hyderabad
 Aug 2020 – June 2025
Investigated the molecular characteristics of gynecologic and breast cancers using bulk multi-omics, single-cell RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics data, with a particular emphasis on metabolic reprogramming.
•
Identified metabolic subtypes of endometrial cancer and characterized them using clinical, transcriptomic, and genomic features, including somatic mutations and copy number variations.
•
Education
PhD scholar specializing in computational systems biology and cancer research, with expertise in multi-omics data integration, deep learning, and single-cell/spatial transcriptomics. Interested in developing data-driven frameworks to understand complex biological systems and diseases, including cancer.
