## Research profile

PhD scholar specializing in computational systems biology and cancer research, with expertise in multi-omics data integration, deep learning, and single-cell/spatial transcriptomics. Interested in developing data-driven frameworks to understand complex biological systems and diseases, including cancer.

## Research experience

- PhD Researcher — IIIT Hyderabad (Aug 2020 – June 2025)
  - Investigated molecular characteristics of gynecologic and breast cancers using bulk multi-omics, single-cell RNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics data, with emphasis on metabolic reprogramming.
  - Identified metabolic subtypes of endometrial cancer and characterized them using clinical, transcriptomic, and genomic features including somatic mutations and copy number variations.
  - Implemented graph-based deep learning frameworks for cancer subtype identification and prognosis prediction using multi-omics data.
  - Proposed a single-cell network approach to characterize metabolic heterogeneity and uncover regulatory programs driving metabolic reprogramming in gynecologic and breast cancers (summer research, IISER Kolkata 2019).

- Research Intern — ROC group, IISER Kolkata (May 2019 – July 2019)
  - Worked on mitochondrial tRNA modification evolutionary patterns and single-cell network approaches.
