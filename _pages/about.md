I am a bioinformatics researcher with expertise in analyzing bulk RNA-seq, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics data using statistical, network-based, and machine/deep learning approaches. 

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics under the supervision of Prof. Vinod P. K. at IIIT Hyderabad, India. My doctoral research focused on characterizing tumor heterogeneity in gynecologic and breast cancers, with an emphasis on understanding cancer metabolism. I have worked on projects ranging from characterizing metabolic heterogeneity and identifying key metabolic regulators at single-cell resolution to uncovering spatial gene expression modules associated with chemotherapy response and developing graph-based deep learning framework for integrating multi-omics data. Collectively, my research work highlights the critical roles of metabolic reprogramming, transcriptional regulation, and spatial heterogeneity in the progression of gynecologic and breast cancers.

I am interested in developing computational frameworks for studying complex human diseases, including cancer.
